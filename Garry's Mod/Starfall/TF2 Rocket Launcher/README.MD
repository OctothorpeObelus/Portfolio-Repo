# Recreation of the Team Fortress 2 stock rocket launcher
This was created on and off in the time frame of a weekend or so, and was done for fun. The end goal was to learn how render targets work as well as how to handle projectile-based weapons. With research and due diligence I was able to faithfully recreate the behaviors of this rocket launcher, including the niche but famous activity of rocket jumping.

As this is moved here for the sake of display, the `require()` functions will not point accurately to filepaths, but will have the same filename.

## Development Screenshots and Videos
Some error popups in these videos are caused due to some players not having the models I'm using, since this uses the models and particle effects from Team Fortress 2.
