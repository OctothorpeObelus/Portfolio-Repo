# Portfolio-Repo
 A repository showing off all of my small projects in one place that weren't big enough to have their own repositories.
 
 ## Other Personal Projects (Repos)
[Carrying Crate Addon](https://github.com/OctothorpeObelus/carrying_crate) - Garry's Mod Addon <br>
[Lambda Bot](https://github.com/OctothorpeObelus/Lambda-Bot) - personal Discord bot for friends (Actively Developed) <br>
[Garry's Mod Block Game](https://github.com/OctothorpeObelus/gmod-block-game) (Unfinished) <br>
[SlashCo](https://github.com/Mantibro/SlashCo) - Garry's Mod Gamemode
  - This was made with a small group of friends, and I wrote the backbone/framework of the gamemode
  - This repository has moved over to Mantibro's account, and as such my original contributions are no longer marked as mine, but as his. The files I created are:
      - [`cl_headbob.lua`](https://github.com/Mantibro/SlashCo/blob/main/gamemodes/slashco/gamemode/cl_headbob.lua)
      - [`globals.lua`](https://github.com/Mantibro/SlashCo/blob/main/gamemodes/slashco/gamemode/globals.lua)
      - [`player.lua`](https://github.com/Mantibro/SlashCo/blob/main/gamemodes/slashco/gamemode/player.lua)
  - I also created the map configuration format alongside the checks to validate them and spawn their entities appropriately
