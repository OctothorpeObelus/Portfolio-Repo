# Recreation of the Team Fortress 2 stock rocket launcher
This was created on and off in the time frame of a weekend or so, and was done for fun. The end goal was to learn how render targets work as well as how to handle projectile-based weapons. With research and due diligence I was able to faithfully recreate the behaviors of this rocket launcher, including the niche but famous activity of rocket jumping.
