# Audio Cassette Tape
This was a weekend long project for a friend of mine who was developing a storytelling map for Garry's Mod. I created a cassette tape from scratch using measurements and references, then created its textures in Substance Painter under a student license. The end result was very satisfactory, though creating new labels for the cassette were quite tedious and time consuming to make. I answered this self-made problem by creating a python script that takes in some information about the label you'd like to make, then does basic image processing to create the desired label. After it is created it is converted into VTF (Valve Texture Format) and its corresponding VMT (Valve Material Format) for use in the game. All that is left that is manual work is adding these new material names to the `$skingroup` inside the model's `.qc` file.

<br>
This version of the model has the fully detailed mesh and more complex inner geometry to show off to the player.

<br>
This is the first reduction of detail in the model, displayed at around 15 feet away from it. It removes much of the geometry and is just a rectangular prism with rounded edges. The texure does the heav lifting of disguising its reduced state.

<br>
This is the most efficient model to render at only 8 vertices. It is simply the texture projected onto a rectangular prism.
