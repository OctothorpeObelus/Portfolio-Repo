# Bell Crank Suspension Visualization
While the actual physics of this system were handled by the game's physics engine, I wasn't satisfied with the result since it had no visual component, so I made one!
This uses the positions of the wheels of the vehicle to visually compute the positions, scales, and angles of several entities to create a convincing visual simulation
of old Japanese-style Bell Crank suspension, commonly found on their older tanks from the 1930's.
