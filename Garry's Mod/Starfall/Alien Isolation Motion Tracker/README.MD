# Alien: Isolation Motion Tracker Recreation

I created this in my spare time to recreate the behaviors of the motion tracker from the game, Alien: Isolation.
I never saw the source code for the original tool used in the game, and only had videos as references.
It detects players and vehicles within a 20 meter radius and appropriately displays them on the tool's screen, rendered using a render target.
